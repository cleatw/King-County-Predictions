# LOCATION FORECASTING USING TIME SERIES FORECASTING

## STAKEHOLDER AND BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING 
Our firm, BTT Consulting has been hired by a real estate property company, OVATION REAL ESTATE. They are looking to invest in five(5) new locations 
around the country. They want locations that assure them of immediate profitability and return on investment. We are focussing on the average value 
of properties to arrive at our recommended locations.

## DATA  &  DATA ANALYSIS
We are making use of Zillow Research data sourced from the Zillow website. The dataset encompasses mean monthly property values in close to 15,000 
zip codes spread around the country from April, 1996 up to April, 2018. We aggregated the data by quarter to arrive at the return on investment (ROI) over 
each quarter. Making use of quarterly Returns on Investment, we were able to arrive at first, the state with the highest ROI, then we narrowed it down to 
metro, county and finally the best performing cities.  

## MODELING
We carried out the bulk of our analyses using Time Series forecasting.
